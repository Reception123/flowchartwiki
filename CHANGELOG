      fixed Path/Directory issues on Windows, including " " <space> in paths
    * changed call to graphviz.exe - may bomb on Windows Server (again) now.
      but should fix problem with " " <spaces> in File-Paths/Filename on Windows.

      ./images/flowchartwiki to avoid clashes in installations, where multiple
      wikis are installed on the same base directory structure.
