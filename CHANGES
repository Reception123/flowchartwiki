FlowchartWiki 1.2.0-beta1
   * major rebuild of .dot file creation,
     reduced Database-accesses and moved data-structure into internal
     object hierarchy (see fchwobjects.php for the objects)
   * This was a prerequsite for adding other features to the graph:
   * Include a Link to the Category-Page on top of the graph,
     if Customizing has a Page-Type "Category".
   * Position all Pages that have no [[Level::xxxx]] assigned at the
     bottom of the graph, sorted in alphabetical order.
   * These pages CAN have a [[Type::xxxx]] assigned to use a shape and Color
     from the customizing. Links to these pages may work, but will probably
     screw up the graph :-)
   * add Customizing-Function fchw['zLevels'] for the number or items
     per row for the "Unassigned" Pages.
   * This can be set in LocalSettings.php. If not set, it defaults to 4
     and is set in flowchartwiki.php.
   * Calculate the Height of the graph based on the approximate number
     of rows. (This may not work properly for <CategoryBrowser2 /> which
     displays two images.)
   * Upgrade from 1.1.x: Replace the extension directory with the new version
     and delete the images in ./images/flowchartwiki

FlowchartWiki 1.1.1
   * ' (Apostroph) in Category-Names bombed the CategoryBrowser with a SQL Error
     Added $dbr->strencode($Category) to many SQL-Statements
   * " " (Blank) in Category-Names did not render the Category Graph on the
     Category Page. (Other Pages were fine.)
     Added $fchw['CurrentCategory'] = str_replace(" ","_",$fchw['CurrentCategory']);
     in CategoryBrowser.php
   * Disabled Logging in flowchartwiki.php which was still enabled by accident.

FlowchartWiki 1.1.0

    * Updated Special:CheckFchw: Testing for display of real graph,
      fixed Path/Directory issues on Windows, including " " <space> in paths
    * changed call to graphviz.exe - may bomb on Windows Server (again) now.
      but should fix problem with " " <spaces> in File-Paths/Filename on Windows.
    * graphviz.php: added $wgDBprefix to the Hash of the Filename in
      ./images/flowchartwiki to avoid clashes in installations, where multiple
      wikis are installed on the same base directory structure.
    * graphviz.php: changed platform-dependend coding to switch-statement
      and tested for availability of $_SERVER["SERVER_SOFTWARE"]
      (this variable is not set in a command-line environment, ie. when called
      by ./extensions/flowchartwiki/maintenance/fchw_RefreshPages.php)
    * categoryBrowser.php: added "concentrate=true;" to .dot file
      This tries to reduce arrows, if the length is > 1 AND there are
      two arrows between two icons, one to, one from --> one arrow to/from.
